                            This paper conducts an empirical investigation of capital expenditures by independent school districts in the United States. Capital spending warrants particular attention due to its significantly more flexible financing compared to current expenditures, which are constrained by numerous institutional factors. This flexibility suggests that school districts may align their capital investments more closely with their preferences. Accordingly, we examine whether capital spending is motivated by enrollment levels or influenced by other factors. Our primary objective is to assess whether capital allocation is optimized relative to enrollment. If capital is optimized with respect to enrollment, estimating the rate of return on capital would be appropriate; if not, such estimation may not be feasible. Our empirical findings indicate that both per capita income and population influence capital spending. Furthermore, we find that school districts do not adjust capital investments over time, resulting in substantial disparities in capital per student across different cohorts. Finally, we observe that capital spending is also related to aspects of the administrative structure, such as the frequency of borrowing. The importance of these findings is that school districts appear unlikely to be on their production possibilities frontier in terms of learning, which suggests estimation of the rate of return to capital spending may not yield meaningful results.

                    Neighborhood Impacts on STEM Choice

                            We show that the neighborhoods where students grow up significantly influence their choice of college major, focusing on students in Texas who move across school districts and counties. By using variation in the grades at which students move, we find substantial exposure effects of neighborhoods on the likelihood of choosing a college STEM major. Specifically, students who move to high-STEM areas—measured by the proportion of non-moving students obtaining a STEM degree—show a linear increase in their probability of selecting a STEM major with the time spent in the new place. To distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from confounding factors, we analyze moves induced by displacement shocks and exploit sharp variations in predicted neighborhood effects across school cohorts, genders, races, and specific college majors. These tests also suggest that the observed exposure effects are not merely due to an overall improvement in educational attainment but due to an increase in major specific exposure. Importantly, we find that the STEM exposure measure is strongly tied to the occupational composition of the neighborhood, further providing causal evidence that neighborhood STEM occupational composition influences students' STEM career choices. Lastly, an examination of heterogeneity across demographic groups reveals that the exposure effect is consistent across different groups, indicating that the positive effects of living in high-STEM areas extend to students from both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged families.

                            This paper examines how exposure to women working during World War II (WWII) influenced adolescents future labor market decisions and educational attainment. Using a difference-in-differences framework and United States (U.S.) Census data, I exploit variation in female labor force participation shocks across State Economic Areas (SEA's) during WWII. My analysis focuses on individuals who were adolescents during the war period, comparing outcomes between those in areas that experienced positive employment shocks versus those that did not. Results indicate that women who grew up in areas with higher female labor force participation during WWII were 1.6 to 7 percentage points more likely to enter the workforce themselves, suggesting a significant role model effect. This relationship remains robust across multiple specifications. The findings contribute to our understanding of how exposure to working women during formative years shapes long-term labor market decisions and highlights the lasting impact of temporary labor market shocks on intergenerational outcomes.

      <img src="images\Headshot.JPG" alt="Brian Murphy"/>
      <p>Hi! My name is Brian Murphy. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Houston. I am interested in labor, human capital, education, development, and health economics.</p>
      <p>I have a B.A. and a B.S. in economics and mathematics from La Salle University in Philadelphia. I graduated Maxima Cum Laude, with a 4.0 GPA. During my undergrad, I was honored to receive the Flubacher Award, given to a student each year who shows commitment to community service and who excels in the classroom. Additionally, I was the recipient of the Geruson Award, given to the student who writes the most outstanding seminar paper. Finally, I was given the most outstanding student award in the College of Liberal Arts.</p>

      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>I am originally from Philadelphia, PA. I played division 1 baseball in my undergrad. As a former athlete, I am a huge sports fan, and I am a massive Philadelphia Eagles, Phillies, 76ers, and Flyers fan. Most of my free time consists of watching their games or going to them.</p>
      <p>I am also a big-time traveler, having been to 15 countries and 31 states. I love learning about culture, trying new foods, and just seeing the world!</p>
      <p> I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. My favorite artists include CAAMP, Mt. Joy, The Lumineers, Kendrick Lamar, and more.</p>
